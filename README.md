This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other parameters.
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end Machine Learning workflow â€” from data preprocessing to model building, pipeline creation, and evaluation.


Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€” handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding

Feature Engineering â€” selected and transformed relevant features for model input

 ML Pipeline Creation â€” automated preprocessing and model training steps using scikit-learn pipelines

 Model Building â€” trained and evaluated a Random Forest Regressor for robust price predictions

 Model Evaluation â€” assessed performance using metrics such as RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error

 Model Saving â€” final model saved as a .pkl file for deployment or inference


 Tech Stack
Python 3.x

NumPy, Pandas â€” for data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn â€” for visualization

Scikit-learn â€” for pipeline creation and Random Forest model

Joblib / Pickle â€” for model serialization
